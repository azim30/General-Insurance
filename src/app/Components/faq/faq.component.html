                                        The different types of car insurance plans are:<br>
                                        Third Party plan: The Indian Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, makes it is compulsory for car owners to have a valid third-party insurance policy, and non-compliance of the rule can lead to heavy penalties. This policy covers bodily injury (or death) or property damages done to any third party in case of an accident caused by the insured party, on the condition that it wasnâ€™t a deliberate act or done under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.<br>
                                        Comprehensive plan: Buying this policy is optional, but it is highly recommended by experts. It covers damage done to your own vehicle as well as that done to a third-party. Apart from accidents, it also covers thefts and damages done to the vehicle by natural calamities like flood, lightning, earthquakes, etc. or malicious acts like riots, strikes, and terrorist activity. This plan can be bought for a single year or for long term.

In addition to it, any third party liability which has arisen due to the use of your two wheeler is covered under bike insurance.

                                        There two types of insurance policies â€“ comprehensive and third party liability. Comprehensive insurance ensures complete protection to your  bike due to any impact damage, fire, theft, earthquake etc. In addition to this, it provides cover against any third party liability in term of death, bodily injury and third party property damage. However, third party liability, which is the mandatory cover protects your vehicle against third party liability against person and property.

                                        The policy will remain more or less the same, but the premium may change depending on the city to which you are moving. This is because the insurance rates differ based on the registration zone of the car. Metro cities usually have a higher rate of premium than the rest of the country. In case of job change, just inform the insurer so that the details are updated. In any case, you need to update your contact details i.e. your new address and phone number, which can be done online.

                                        That is unlikely. It is recommended that you inform the insurer at the earliest. The period of intimation may be sometimes as short as two days. After the specified time period lapses, the insurer reserves the right to cancel any claim application.

                                        There is no limit to the number of claims that one can register during the policy period. However, the policyholder can claim until the consolidated claim amount reaches up to the Insured Declared Value (IDV) of the car. Also, claims have an impact on your premium at the time of renewal.

                                        When a policyholder doesnâ€™t make any claims during the policy period, he/she is rewarded with a No Claim Bonus (NCB). Now, this discount can range from 20% upto 50%, depending upon your track record of not making a claim. While making a claim for massive damages serves the whole purpose of taking insurance, if you let go of small damages, you can avail a decent discount in the form of NCB. So, itâ€™s advisable to pay for minor repairs instead of making a claim and losing that NCB, which by the way, only increases with every passing year.

Apart from a discount on your insurance premium, your insurer is most likely to offer additional benefits when you renew the policy. These rewards might include a sizeable decrease in deductibles or an accident forgiveness option, which means zero increase in premium even after an accident.

                                        Yes. The reward for not making a claim during the policy period can be easily transferred from one insurer to another, if the policyholder decides to buy insurance from another insurance company. Similarly, if the car owner changes his vehicle, NCB can be transferred to the new car.

                                        If you have witnessed a significant rise in the insurance premium during renewal, it might be because of loading. Simply put, it is the amount that is added to a policy to cover for losses which were higher than what the insurer was anticipating. This comes into the picture if the policyholder is prone to a certain type of risk or opts for claims quite often. Loading protects insurance companies against high-risk individuals.

                                    You can take the following steps to save on car insurance premium:  
                                    <br>
                                    1.Compare the quotes by different insurers and pick the one that provides more benefits at a lower price.
                                    <br>
                                    2. Ask about bundling your insurance:If you have home insurance, you can ask your current provider about car insurance as well. Sometimes, insurance providers may give a discount on car insurance premium, if you already have home insurance or have another vehicle insured with them.
                                    <br>
                                    3. Maintain a good credit score:The policy premium is also calculated based on the credit score, as people with a good score make fewer claims.

                                        Yes. Both the make and model of your vehicle influence the cost of your insurance premium. The premium for a luxury sports car will be more than a hatchback for instance. This is because any damage to a luxury car will need a costlier repair.

                                        Low IDV or Insured Declared Value means you are insuring your vehicle below the market value, and so, your premium will be less. However, at the time of making a claim, the compensation amount will be less and you may have to bear some of the loss. Experts recommend that instead of higher or lower IDV, you go for the right IDV.
